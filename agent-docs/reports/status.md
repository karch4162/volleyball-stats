# STATUS

- **Date:** 2025-01-XX (Updated after Rally Capture UI refinements and testing preparation)
- **Phase:** Phase 2 – Simplified Architecture & Local Storage + UI/UX Improvements + Stat Tracking
- **Summary:** Major UI/UX overhaul of rally capture screen completed with comprehensive stat tracking. Implemented scoreboard-first layout with prominent running totals, quick-tap player action grid, and one-tap win/loss buttons. Reduced data entry from 3-4 taps to 1 tap for most actions. Added real-time stat tracking (FBK, Wins, Losses, Transition Points, Substitutions, Timeouts) and per-player statistics breakdown with attack efficiency calculations. Latest refinements include player action buttons with live stat counts, glass theme styling with shadow glow effects, collapsible score and timeout cards for better screen space, team name display, and improved layout consistency. All core functionality working with improved user experience optimized for mobile use during live matches. Ready for comprehensive user testing.
