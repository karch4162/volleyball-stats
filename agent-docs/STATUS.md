# STATUS

- **Date:** 2025-11-09T21:25Z
- **Phase:** Phase 1 – Data Modeling & Supabase Foundation
- **Summary:** Supabase match draft flow is now live: schema migration + seed data for `match_drafts`, RLS verified against the linked project, and Flutter uses a Supabase-backed repository layered with an offline cache abstraction (in-memory placeholder for future Drift/Hive). Wizard saves/loads drafts remotely while retaining test-friendly in-memory mode.
- **Completed:** Flutter `pub get` + `flutter test`, `npm install`, initial Supabase schema (`supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`), GitHub Actions workflow, schema notes (`docs/schema-notes.md`), RLS policy plan (`docs/rls-policy-plan.md`), match setup outline (`docs/flutter-match-setup-plan.md`), RLS migration (`supabase/migrations/0002_rls_policies.sql`), RLS pgTAP test (`supabase/tests/rls_policies.test.sql`) passing against linked project, seed dataset (`supabase/seed.sql`) applied (roster + draft records), Supabase-backed match setup repository + Riverpod providers (`app/lib/features/match_setup/data/supabase_match_setup_repository.dart`), cached repository wrapper + local cache abstraction (`app/lib/features/match_setup/data/cached_match_setup_repository.dart`), Dart-define Supabase bootstrap (`app/lib/core/supabase.dart`), README runtime instructions, expanded widget tests for roster/rotation validation.
- **Next Up:** Backfill integration tests hitting Supabase via the repository layer, swap the cache implementation to Drift/Hive for persistence, and wire the wizard completion into rally capture navigation.
- **Blockers:** None.
