# STATUS

- **Date:** 2025-01-XX (Updated after Rally Capture UI improvements and stat tracking enhancements)
- **Phase:** Phase 2 – Simplified Architecture & Local Storage + UI/UX Improvements + Stat Tracking
- **Summary:** Major UI/UX overhaul of rally capture screen completed with comprehensive stat tracking. Implemented scoreboard-first layout with prominent running totals, quick-tap player action grid, and one-tap win/loss buttons. Reduced data entry from 3-4 taps to 1 tap for most actions. Added real-time stat tracking (FBK, Wins, Losses, Transition Points, Substitutions, Timeouts) and per-player statistics breakdown with attack efficiency calculations. Substitution limit tracking (15 per set) and attack attempt tracking for complete efficiency ratios. All core functionality working with improved user experience optimized for mobile use during live matches.
