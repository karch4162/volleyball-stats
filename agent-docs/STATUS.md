- **Phase:** Phase 1 – Data Modeling & Supabase Foundation
- **Summary:** Supabase match draft flow is live: schema + seed data, RLS verified, Flutter uses a Supabase-backed repository layered with a Hive cache, match setup launches a rally capture scaffold that preloads the draft + roster, and the rally capture UI now includes rotation tracker, roster panes, timeline placeholder, action grid, and rally controls.
- **Completed:** Flutter `pub get` + `flutter test`, `npm install`, initial Supabase schema (`supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`), GitHub Actions workflow, schema notes (`docs/schema-notes.md`), RLS policy plan (`docs/rls-policy-plan.md`), match setup outline (`docs/flutter-match-setup-plan.md`), RLS migration (`supabase/migrations/0002_rls_policies.sql`), RLS pgTAP test (`supabase/tests/rls_policies.test.sql`) passing against linked project, seed dataset (`supabase/seed.sql`) applied (roster + draft records), Supabase-backed match setup repository + Riverpod providers (`app/lib/features/match_setup/data/supabase_match_setup_repository.dart`), cached repository wrapper + Hive cache (`app/lib/features/match_setup/data/cached_match_setup_repository.dart`, `match_draft_cache.dart`), Dart-define Supabase bootstrap (`app/lib/core/supabase.dart`), README runtime instructions, expanded widget tests for roster/rotation validation, Supabase integration tests (`app/test/integration/match_setup_repository_test.dart`) now exercised in CI via secrets, match setup `Finish` navigation into rally capture scaffold (`app/lib/features/rally_capture/rally_capture_screen.dart`), rally capture layout with rotation tracker, roster panels, action grid, timeline & controls (`app/lib/features/rally_capture/rally_capture_screen.dart`).
- **Next Up:** Flesh out the rally capture controls/timeline with real data entry logic and add navigation back to match setup for edits.
- **Blockers:** None.
